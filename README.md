- I am very interested in the job prospects of software engineers after age 35 because a lot of software engineers leave. 

- There is a huge disparity between the proportion of male and female software engineers in the US, 80.7% of software developers in the US are male, while females account for the remaining 19.3%.

## Comment from Larry Li

- These statistics offered interesting perspectives on the current developer job market. I did not know there exists such a huge gap between the number of female developers and the number of male developers. It's also surprising to know that "69% of developers use Javascript as their primary programming language."
